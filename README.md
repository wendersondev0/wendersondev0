## 👋 Hello everyone

I am a **Software Developer / Systems Analyst** with a strong focus on **backend development using .NET technologies**.

I have experience building **scalable, maintainable, and performance-oriented applications**, working mainly with **ASP.NET Core**, **REST APIs**, and **relational databases**. I enjoy solving complex business logic problems, optimizing SQL queries, and designing clean backend architectures.

Currently, I am pursuing a degree in **Systems Analysis and Development**, while continuously improving my skills through online courses and hands-on projects.
